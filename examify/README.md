# React + Vite

    This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

    Currently, two official plugins are available:

    - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
    - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

    | Requested changes | Hi @  Your app shows that you’ve invested a considerable amount of thought and effort in its design & implementation. <br/><br/>Please make the following change and then open a ticket in <#1105911757177888908> when you are ready for me to look at it again. ``` **_This is the only change you are required to make._** ``` <br/><br/> ```__**Requested changes**__``` <br/> 1. ... <br/><br/>```**__Here’s additional feedback that I hope will be helpful__**```. |
    | Requested changes - no GH repo URL or deployed URL | Hi @  I started to review your Solo Project, but you haven’t provided a valid URL for a specific GitHub repo or the URL where it’s deployed on the Internet. <br/><br/> Your GitHub repo URL generates a page not found error. This can happen if your repo is private instead of public. <br/><br/> We ask for this so we can not only look at your code, but also the running application and its UI/UX. In addition, knowing how to deploy to a web host like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Render, etc. is a skill you’ll need in your Voyage. <br/><br/> Please open a ticket in <#1105911757177888908> when you have these URL's and we'll start the evaluation. Thanks! |
    | Requested changes - no GH repo URL or deployed URL (PO's) |Hi @ I started to review your Solo Project, but you haven’t provided a valid URL for where it’s located on the Internet. <br/><br/>We ask for this so we can evaluate your current expertise as a Product Owner. This will help both you and us validate that you've chosen the right tier before you start a Voyage.<br/><br/>If you have questions about what's required take a look at our [Solo Project Guide](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/Handbook/blob/main/docs/guides/soloproject/soloproject.md#solo-project-guide).<br/><br/>Please open a ticket in <#1105911757177888908> when you have this URL and we'll start the evaluation. Thanks! |
    | Requested changes - no deployed URL | I started to review your Solo Project, but you haven’t provided a valid URL for where it’s deployed on the Internet. <br/><br/>We ask for this so we can not only look at your code, but also the running application and its UI/UX.

    | Repo URL not found |	I started to review your Solo Project, but the URL you’ve provided for your repo is not found (HTTP/404). <br/><br/>This often happens if the repo is marked as private in GitHub instead of public. <br/><br/>Please open a ticket in <#1105911757177888908> when you have this URL and we'll start the evaluation. Thanks! |
    | Requested changes - old project ( last change over 12 months ago) |	I started to review your Solo Project, but the project you provided was not developed within the last 12 months, or have a significant number of commits made to it by you within the last year. It's likely that you have learnt a lot more in the last 12 months and this project is not an accurate reflection of your current ability, Or you have not been coding for the last 12 months and likely to have forgotten how to code. <br/><br/>Please open a ticket in <#1105911757177888908> when you have a newer project and we'll start the evaluation. Thanks! |
    | Requested changes - submitted project tier is lower than applied tier |	Hi @ I started to review your Solo Project, but this Solo Project is a Tier 2, rather than a Tier 3 app. Would you like to submit another tier 3 project or continue with this tier 2 project? Which means you'll be eligible to join a tier 2 team if the project is accepted.  You can learn more about our tiers and the requirements of each here —> https://github.com/chingu-voyages/Handbook/blob/main/docs/guides/soloproject/soloproject.md#1-choose-your-tier<br/><br/>Please open a ticket in <#1105911757177888908> and lets us know. Thanks! |
